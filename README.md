# Information-Retrieval-Project

Create an application to retrieve songs given free-form text queries 
   Examples:
Find a song by remembering only a few words
Find a song that talk about some specific topics

Exploit latent semantic indexing in order to deal with concepts instead of terms and reduce the size of the problem
